# Make Blink - Week 3
## STM32F411E-DISCO Evaluation Board
On your final project board, make blinky for yourself. Then add a button to turn the LED on and
off. Bonus points for making the button cause an interrupt. Triple bonus points for debouncing
the button signal.

## What are the hardware registers that cause the LED to turn on and off? 
GPIO port output regiser:  GPIOD_ODR
## What are the registers that you read in order to find out the state of the button?

## Can you read the register directly and see the button change in a debugger?
